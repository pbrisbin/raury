# Raury

Every time I look at [aurget][], I want to refactor. Every time I start 
to refactor aurget, I stop because it's in bash.

This is my second attempt at the Aur Helper Pattern in ruby. The goals 
are as follows:

1. Be as featureful as aurget
2. Be markedly faster than most existing helpers
3. Have an elegant, small, easy to work with codebase
4. Solid test coverage

We shall see...
